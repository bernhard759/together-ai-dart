# Together AI Dart Package

The Together AI Dart package provides a convenient way to interact with the Together AI API using Dart. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for generating text, images, and more using various AI models.

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for generating text and images
- Support for multiple AI models, including chat and image generation models
- Seamless integration with the Together AI API
- Robust error handling with detailed error messages
- Strongly-typed responses using entity models
- Enum-based model selection for type safety and code readability

## Installation

To use the Together AI Dart package in your project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  together_ai: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `dart pub get` to fetch the package.

## Usage

First, import the package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:together_ai/together_ai.dart';
```

### Initializing the Together AI SDK

Create an instance of the `TogetherAISDK` class with your API key and the desired model:

```dart
final togetherAI = TogetherAISDK(
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  model: TogetherAIChatModel.glmInstruct7B,
);
```

### Generating Text

To generate text using a chat model, use the `chatCompletion` method:

```dart
final response = await togetherAI.chatCompletion(
  prompt: 'Hello, how are you?',
  maxTokens: 100,
  temperature: 0.7,
);

print(response.choices[0].text);
```

### Generating Images

To generate an image, use the `generateImage` method:

```dart
final response = await togetherAI.generateImage(
  prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over the ocean',
  model: TogetherAIImageModel.stableDiffusionXL1_0,
  numImages: 1,
  size: '512x512',
);

print(response.data[0].url);
```

### Error Handling

The Together AI Dart package provides comprehensive error handling. If an error occurs during an API request, a `TogetherAIError` instance will be thrown. You can catch and handle specific error types based on the error code.

```dart
try {
  final response = await togetherAI.chatCompletion(...);
  // Handle the response
} on TogetherAIError catch (error) {
  if (error is AuthenticationError) {
    // Handle authentication error
  } else if (error is BadRequest) {
    // Handle bad request error
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

## Models

The Together AI Dart package supports various chat and image generation models. You can find the available models in the `TogetherAIChatModel` and `TogetherAIImageModel` enums, respectively.
